THERE\n   HAS BEEN INCREASED FIGHTING ALONG THE RED SEA\n   COAST AND THERE IS A RISK THAT U.S. FLAGGED\n   COMMERCIAL VESSELS OPERATING IN THE AREA COULD\n   BE ASSOCIATED WITH ANTI-HOUTHI OPERATIONS,\n   OR OTHERWISE AT RISK. U.S. FLAGGED VESSELS\n   OPERATING IN THIS VICINITY SHOULD EXERCISE\n   EXTREME CAUTION.\n3. GUIDANCE: IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT U.S. FLAGGED\n   COMMERCIAL VESSELS AVOID ENTERING OR LOITERING\n   NEAR YEMENS RED SEA PORTS, AND THAT VESSELS AT\n   ANCHOR, OPERATING IN RESTRICTED MANEUVERING\n   ENVIRONMENTS OR AT SLOW SPEEDS, BE ESPECIALLY\n   VIGILANT.
