THE NEW SYSTEM ESTABLISHES A\n   SINGLE FEDERAL PROCESS TO EXPEDITIOUSLY\n   PROVIDE MARITIME THREAT INFORMATION TO\n   MARITIME INDUSTRY STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING\n   VESSELS AT SEA. IN RESPONSE TO VALUABLE\n   FEEDBACK FROM STAKEHOLDERS, THE MARITIME\n   ADVISORY SYSTEM WAS DEVELOPED TO STREAMLINE,\n   CONSOLIDATE, AND REPLACE MARITIME THREAT\n   INFORMATION PREVIOUSLY DISSEMINATED IN THREE\n   SEPARATE GOVERNMENT AGENCY INSTRUMENTS:\n   SPECIAL WARNINGS, MARAD ADVISORIES, AND\n   GLOBAL MARITIME SECURITY RELATED MARINE\n   SAFETY INFORMATION BULLETINS.\n2. THE U.S. MARITIME ADVISORY SYSTEM INCLUDES\n   TWO TYPES OF NOTIFICATIONS: A U.S. MARITIME\n   ALERT AND A U.S. MARITIME ADVISORY.\n   MARITIME ALERTS QUICKLY PROVIDE BASIC\n   THREAT INFORMATION TO THE MARITIME INDUSTRY.\n   WHEN AMPLIFYING INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE,\n   A MORE DETAILED U.S. MARITIME ADVISORY MAY\n   BE ISSUED ON A THREAT AND COULD INCLUDE\n   RECOMMENDATIONS AND IDENTIFY AVAILABLE\n   RESOURCES. U.S. MARITIME ALERTS AND\n   U.S. MARITIME ADVISORIES WILL BE BROADCAST\n   BY THE NATIONAL GEOSPATIAL-INTELLIGENCE\n   AGENCY, EMAILED TO MARITIME INDUSTRY\n   STAKEHOLDERS, AND POSTED TO THE MARITIME\n   SECURITY COMMUNICATIONS WITH INDUSTRY (MSCI)\n   WEB PORTAL, AT www.marad.dot.gov/MSCI/.\n3. THE U.S. MARITIME ADVISORY SYSTEM IS A\n   WHOLE-OF-GOVERNMENT NOTIFICATION MECHANISM.\n   THE DEPARTMENTS OF STATE, DEFENSE, JUSTICE,\n   TRANSPORTATION, AND HOMELAND SECURITY, AND\n   THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY, SUPPORTED THE\n   DEVELOPMENT OF THIS NEW SYSTEM. IN\n   COORDINATION WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM\n   THE U.S. MARITIME INDUSTRY THROUGH THE\n   ALERTS, WARNINGS AND NOTIFICATIONS WORKING\n   GROUP.\n4. QUESTIONS REGARDING THE U.S. MARITIME ADVISORY\n   SYSTEM MAY BE EMAILED TO MARADSecurity@dot.gov.\n   ADDITIONAL CONTACT INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE\n   ON THE MSCI WEB PORTAL.\n5. CANCEL THIS MSG 06 JUL 17."
