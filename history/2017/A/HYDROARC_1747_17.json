U.S. FLAGGED\n   OPERATORS WITH VESSELS IN THE AFFECTED AREA ARE\n   REQUESTED TO FORWARD THIS ADVISORY TO THEIR\n   SHIPS BY THE MOST EXPEDITIOUS MEANS.\n2. PIRATES/ARMED GROUPS OPERATING IN THE GOG REGION\n   CONTINUE TO CARRY OUT ATTACKS ON VESSELS USING\n   AUTOMATIC WEAPONS. HIJACKINGS OF TANKERS FOR CARGO\n   THEFT (REFINED PETROLEUM PRODUCTS), SHIP'S\n   PROPERTY, ROBBERY OF CREW, AND KIDNAPPINGS FOR\n   RANSOM (KFR) CONTINUE TO BE THE MOST COMMON\n   THREATS.

PIRATES HAVE USED MOTHERSHIPS TO\n   SUPPORT OPERATIONS UP TO 150 NAUTICAL MILES\n   OFFSHORE. PIRATES/ARMED KFR GROUPS HAVE BEEN\n   KNOWN TO FIRE UPON TARGETED VESSELS PRIOR TO\n   ATTEMPTING TO BOARDING THEM. KFR GROUPS\n   GENERALLY KIDNAP TWO TO SIX HIGH VALUE CREWMEMBERS\n   TO INCLUDE THE MASTER, CHIEF ENGINEER, AND ANY\n   WESTERN CREWMEMBERS. KIDNAPPED CREWMEMBERS ARE\n   NORMALLY TAKEN ASHORE IN THE NIGER DELTA REGION,\n   WHERE KFR GROUPS DEMAND RANSOM PAYMENTS IN\n   EXCHANGE FOR THE CREWMEMBERS SAFE RETURN.\n4.
