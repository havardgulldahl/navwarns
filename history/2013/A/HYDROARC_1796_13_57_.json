U.S. FLAG OPERATORS WITH SHIPS IN THE AFFECTED\n   AREA ARE REQUESTED TO FORWARD THIS ADVISORY TO\n   THEIR SHIPS BY THE MOST EXPEDITIOUS MEANS.\n3. PIRATES/ARMED GROUPS OPERATING IN GULF OF GUINEA\n   REGION CONTINUE TO CARRY OUT ATTACKS ON VESSELS\n   USING AUTOMATIC WEAPONS. HIJACKINGS OF TANKERS\n   FOR CARGO THEFT (REFINED PETROLEUM PRODUCTS),\n   ROBBERY OF CREW, PASSENGERS AND SHIPS PROPERTY\n   AND KIDNAPPINGS FOR RANSOM (KFR) CONTINUE TO\n   BE THE MOST COMMON TYPE OF INCIDENTS.\n4. DURING 2011, PIRATES/ARMED GROUPS HIJACKED\n   TANKERS LADEN WITH REFINED PETROLEUM PRODUCTS\n   FOR FUEL THEFT OFF THE NIGERIAN AND BENIN COASTS.\n   IN 2012, PIRATES/ARMED GROUPS EXPANDED THEIR\n   OPERATIONS WESTWARD AND BEGAN ALSO HIJACKING\n   TANKERS OFF TOGO AND THE IVORY COAST.\n   IN MID-JULY 2013, PIRATES/ARMED GROUPS HIJACKED\n   A TANKER NEAR PORT GENTIL OFF THE COAST OF GABON\n   AND AN UNIDENTIFIED GROUP ATTEMPTED TO BOARD\n   A U.S. FLAG VESSEL AT ANCHOR IN LOME, TOGO\n   BUT WERE REPELLED BY THE CREW USING FIRE HOSES.\n5. PIRATES/ARMED KFR GROUPS CONTINUE TO TARGET\n   SMALL TUGS AND SUPPLY VESSELS SUPPORTING OIL\n   DRILLING AND EXPLORATION OFF THE NIGER DELTA,\n   BUT IN RECENT MONTHS HAVE ALSO BEGUN TO TARGET\n   MERCHANT VESSELS (TANKER AND CARGO SHIPS)\n   TRANSITING AND OPERATING IN THE REGION.\n   PIRATES/ARMED GROUPS HAVE USED MOTHERSHIPS TO\n   SUPPORT SOME KFR OPERATIONS AND HAVE OPERATED\n   UP TO 150 NAUTICAL MILES FROM THE COAST.\n6. PIRATES/ARMED KFR GROUPS SOMETIMES FIRE UPON\n   VESSELS BEFORE BOARDING THEM. THEY NORMALLY\n   TAKE THE MASTER AND SEVERAL OTHER CREWMEMBERS\n   OFF THE VESSEL AND DEMAND A RANSOM IN EXCHANGE\n   FOR THEIR SAFE RETURN.\n7. U.S. FLAG OPERATORS WITH SHIPS IN THE SUBJECT\n   HIGH RISK WATERS (HRW) SHOULD TRANSIT WITH\n   EXTREME CAUTION AND VIGILANCE.\n8. U.S. FLAG VESSELS TRANSITING AND OPERATING\n   IN SUBJECT WATERS MUST COMPLY WITH\n   U.S. COAST GUARD MARSEC DIRECTIVE 104-6\n   (CURRENT VERSION) AND ACCORDINGLY, SHOULD\n   CONDUCT A PRE-VOYAGE RISK ASSESSMENT AND\n   INCORPORATE APPROPRIATE PROTECTIVE MEASURES\n   INTO THEIR VESSEL SECURITY PLAN.\n9. A SHIP HOSTILE ACTION REPORT (SHAR) SHOULD\n   BE SENT TO THE NATIONAL GEOSPATIAL\n   INTELLIGENCE AGENCY (NGA) AT\n   http:msi.nga.mil/NGAPortal/MSI.portal\n   AS SOON AS POSSIBLE FOLLOWING ANY\n   INCIDENT/SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY, INCLUDING\n   APPARENT SURVEILLANCE BEING CONDUCTED\n   BY SMALL VESSELS/BOATS.
