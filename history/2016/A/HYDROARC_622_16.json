THE WORLD HEALTH\n   ORGANIZATION HAS DECLARED THAT THE RECENT\n   CLUSTER OF NEUROLOGIC DISORDERS IN LATIN AMERICA,\n   BUT NOT THE ZIKA VIRUS ITSELF, CONSTITUTES A\n   PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY OF INTERNATIONAL CONCERN.\n4. ZIKA IS A VIRUS THAT IS PRIMARILY SPREAD BY\n   MOSQUITOES AND MAY ALSO BE SPREAD VIA BLOOD\n   TRANSFUSIONS, SEXUAL CONTACT AND FROM MOTHER TO\n   CHILD DURING PREGNANCY. ONLY ABOUT ONE IN FIVE\n   PEOPLE INFECTED WITH THE ZIKA VIRUS WILL EXHIBIT\n   ANY SYMPTOMS. THOSE WHO DO MAY EXPERIENCE FEVER,\n   JOINT PAIN, CONJUNCTIVITIS, MUSCLE PAIN AND/OR\n   A HEADACHE. THE CDC IS ALSO INVESTIGATING A\n   POSSIBLE LINK BETWEEN BIRTH DEFECTS AND ZIKA\n   INFECTION DURING PREGNANCY.\n5. THERE IS NO VACCINE FOR ZIKA VIRUS. TRAVELERS TO\n   AFFECTED AREAS (SEE HTTP:WWW.CDC.GOV/ZIKA/GEO/)\n   SHOULD FOCUS ON PREVENTING MOSQUITO BITES BY\n   WEARING LONG SLEEVES AND PANTS, USING EPA\n   RECOMMENDED INSECT SPRAY PER LABEL DIRECTIONS\n   AND TAKING OTHER PRECAUTIONS LISTED AT\n   HTTP://WWW.CDC.GOV/ZIKA/PREVENTION/.\n6. ZIKA VIRUS CAN BE SPREAD BY MEN TO SEX PARTNERS.\n   CDC RECOMMENDS THAT MEN WHO RESIDE IN OR HAVE\n   TRAVELED TO AN AREA OF ACTIVE ZIKA VIRUS\n   TRANSMISSION EITHER ABSTAIN FROM SEX OR USE\n   CONDOMS CONSISTENTLY AND CORRECTLY. THERE IS\n   NO EVIDENCE THAT ZIKA VIRUS CAN BE SPREAD BY\n   WOMEN TO SEX PARTNERS. CDC RECOMMENDS, HOWEVER,\n   THAT IF ANYONE HAS ANY CONCERNS, THEY SHOULD\n   EITHER ABSTAIN FROM SEX OR USE CONDOMS\n   (SEE HTTP://WWW.CDC.GOV/ZIKA/TRANSMISSION/\n   SEXUAL-TRANSMISSION.HTML).\n7. MARINERS ARE ADVISED TO CONSULT\n   HTTP://WWW.CDC.GOV/ZIKA/ REGULARLY FOR CURRENT\n   UPDATES ON THIS HEALTH THREAT AND MARINE SAFETY\n   INFORMATION BULLETIN 01-16 (CHANGE 2) AT\n   WWW.USCG.MIL/MSIB FOR INFORMATION ON MARITIME\n   INDUSTRY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR VESSEL\n   CREWMEMBERS OR PASSENGERS WHO MAY BE EXHIBITING\n   SYMPTOMS OF ZIKA VIRUS.\n8.
