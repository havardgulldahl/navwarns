ROUTE PLANNING AND MONITORING\n   ALARMS FOR THESE SHOAL DEPTHS MAY NOT ALWAYS BE\n   ACTIVATED. TO ENSURE SAFE NAVIGATION AND TO CONFIRM\n   THAT A PLANNED ROUTE IS CLEAR OF SUCH DANGERS,\n   MARINERS SHOULD VISUALLY INSPECT THE PLANNED ROUTE\n   AND ANY DEVIATIONS FROM IT USING ECDIS CONFIGURED TO\n   DISPLAY \"ALL DATA\". THE AUTOMATED VOYAGE PLANNING\n   CHECK FUNCTION SHOULD NOT BE SOLELY RELIED UPON. THE\n   INTERNATIONAL HYDROGRAPHIC ORGANIZATION (IHO) IS\n   LEADING TECHNICAL ACTION TO RESOLVE THIS MATTER.\n2. NGA HAS DONE A REVIEW OF DNC AND HAS CONCLUDED\n   THAT THIS ERROR DOES NOT EFFECT DNC.\n3. CANCEL HYDROLANT 294/10."
