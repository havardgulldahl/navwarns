ROUTE PLANNING AND MONITORING\nALARMS FOR THESE SHOAL DEPTHS MAY NOT ALWAYS BE\nACTIVATED. TO ENSURE SAFE NAVIGATION AND TO CONFIRM\nTHAT A PLANNED ROUTE IS CLEAR OF SUCH DANGERS,\nMARINERS SHOULD VISUALLY INSPECT THE PLANNED ROUTE\nAND ANY DEVIATIONS FROM IT USING ECDIS CONFIGURED TO\nDISPLAY \"ALL DATA\". THE AUTOMATED VOYAGE PLANNING\nCHECK FUNCTION SHOULD NOT BE SOLELY RELIED UPON. THE\nINTERNATIONAL HYDROGRAPHIC ORGANIZATION (IHO) IS\nLEADING TECHNICAL ACTION TO RESOLVE THIS MATTER."
