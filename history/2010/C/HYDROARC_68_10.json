AS PREVIOUSLY NOTIFIED BY\n   HYDROLANT 294/10, 322/10 AND\n   HYDROPAC 303/10, 337/10, MARINERS\n   USING ECDIS ARE ADVISED NOT TO RELY\n   SOLELY ON AUTOMATED VOYAGE PLANNING AND\n   MONITORING CHECKS AND ALARMS. IT IS\n   RECOMMENDED THAT MARINERS UNDERTAKE\n   CAREFUL VISUAL INSPECTION OF THE ENTIRE\n   PLANNED ROUTE TO CONFIRM THAT IT, AND\n   ANY DEVIATIONS FROM IT, IS CLEAR OF\n   DANGERS. THE ECDIS DISPLAY SHOULD BE\n   CONFIGURED TO DISPLAY ALL SOUNDINGS\n   DURING THIS INSPECTION.\n2. PARTICULAR CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN WHEN\n   PLANNED ROUTES CROSS AREAS WHERE ONLY\n   SMALL SCALE ENCS (USAGE BANDS 1 AND 2)\n   ARE AVAILABLE. IN SOME DISPLAY\n   CONFIGURATIONS, SUCH AS WHEN NO NAMES\n   ARE SHOWN, SMALL ISLANDS AND OTHER POINT\n   FEATURES MAY BE DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY OR\n   COULD BE OBSCURED BY SURROUNDING DEPTH\n   CONTOURS. SOME ECDIS SYSTEMS APPEAR ONLY\n   TO UNDERTAKE ROUTE CHECK FUNCTIONS ON\n   LARGER SCALE ENCS AND THEREFORE ALARMS\n   MIGHT NOT ACTIVATE. THIS MAY NOT BE\n   CLEARLY INDICATED ON THE ECDIS DISPLAY.\n3. THE INTERNATIONAL HYDROGRAPHIC\n   ORGANIZATION (IHO) IS LEADING TECHNICAL\n   ACTION TO INVESTIGATE THESE MATTERS IN\n   CONSULTATION WITH ECDIS EQUIPMENT\n   MANUFACTURERS. FURTHER INFORMATION WILL\n   BE MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH NOTICES TO\n   MARINERS.\n4. THIS ERROR DOES NOT EFFECT DNC."
